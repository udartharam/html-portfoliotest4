<h1>The Best Movies According to Udi</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>The Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>I love these films because I grew up watching them with my sister. They have elves and trees, so I think that makes them Christmas films.</p>

<h3>The Harry Potter Series </h3>
<p>Again, I grew up on these films and their respective books. I absolutely love them.<br />
 Definiely also have a Christmas feel to them during the first 2 -3 films.</p>

<h3>Mean Girls</h3>
<p>A cult classic. I watch this film every year on October 3rd. I love watching this with my family.</p>
