<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Udi. I am a 29-year-old aspiring developer from Cape Town, South Africa.
  I was born in a little town in KZN, South Africa, but moved to Cape Town at the tender age of 3.
</p>

<p>I got into music when I was very young.The first instrument that I wanted to play was the trumpet. The second was the guitar.
  I didn't end up playing the trumpet, but as you guessed,the guitar called my name.
  From there, I went along a musical journey. I eventually picked up the drums in high school, and went on to become the leader of the wind band.
</p>

<p>I wanted to study music when I finished school, but that did not go to plan. 
  Instead, I started working and eventually started pursuing a degree through the University of South Africa.
  I am currently studying toward my BSc in Life Sciences.
</p>

<p>Whilst studying, I am also working to fund these studies. 
  I am a talent acquistion specialist at a South African IT conuslting business.
</p>

<p>When I am not working, studying or playing music, you can find me working on some personal developement.
  Such as this website! I am learning to code so that I can bridge the gap in this ever-changing world of technology.
